<h3>Instructions 3/3</h3>

<p>
In this HIT, you will read sentences and be asked to decide which reading (verb, noun, or whole sentence hedging) you think is most natural. We will provide example justifications for each reading, so that you can see examples of noun, verb, and sentence hedging in each case. You may, however, feel free to invent your own reasons for each kind of hedging.
</p>
<p>
In each sentence, we will indicate whether "sorta" is stressed (<span style='font-size:150%'><b>sorta</b></span>) or unstressed (<span style='font-size:50%'>sorta</span>).
  This may or may not affect your interpretation, but be sure to consider only the indicated stress pattern in making your response.
  Avoid adding extra stress elsewhere in the sentence.
</p>

<p>
   On the next two pages, we will provide example items to familiarize you with the procedure.
