<h4>Hedging the verb</h4>
<p>
  With the sentence "The soccer player sorta kicked a ball", the speaker could be <b>hedging the verb</b> "kicked" to express
'The player did something close to but not quite kicking a ball.' 
</p>
<p>
  There are many possible reasons for hedging this verb with <i>sorta</i>.
The speaker may have chosen to use the verb "kicked" with a hedge because he does not know an appropriate word for this action, but thinks that "kicked" is close.
Or, perhaps the player only nudged the ball, but the speaker wants to give him credit for doing something similar to kicking the ball.

<h4>Hedging the noun</h4>
<p>
  With the sentence "The soccer player sorta kicked a ball", the speaker could also be <b>hedging the noun</b> "ball" to express 'The soccer player kicked something that was like a ball.' 
</p>
<p>
  Again,
  there are many possible reasons for hedging this noun with <i>sorta</i>. For example, the speaker may have chosen to use the noun "ball" with a hedge because what the soccer player kicked was actually just a big wad of crumpled up paper, but the speaker thinks that "ball" is a close enough description.
</p>

<h4>Hedging the whole sentence</h4>
<p>
  With the sentence "The soccer player sorta kicked a ball", the speaker could also be <b>hedging the whole sentence</b> to distance himself from it. For example, perhaps the soccer player was not supposed to kick the ball, and the speaker is hesitant to fully admit what happened, in case it will get the soccer player in trouble. In this case, he may be using the hedge <i>sorta</i> to express something like
  'The soccer player kicked a ball, but I am afraid to tell you this in case it gets him in trouble.'
